            Artificial Legal Person:
A company is created by law and has rights and powers similar to a natural person, such as the ability to enter contracts and own property. 
Separate Legal Entity:
The company is distinct from its owners and members, meaning its debts are not the personal responsibility of the owners beyond their capital investment. 
Incorporated Body:
A company must be registered under a Companies Act, which gives it its legal identity or "corporate personality". 
Perpetual Succession:
A company continues to exist even if its members change or die, as its existence is tied to the law rather than its individuals.
